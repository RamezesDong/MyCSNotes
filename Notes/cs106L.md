2. Design Philosophy of C++
   - Only add features if they can solve an actual problem
   - Programmers should be free to choose their own style 
   - Compartmentalization is key
   - Allow the programmer full control if they want it
   - Don’t sacrifice performance expect as a last resort
   - Enforce safety at compile time whenever possible

## Types and Streams

- `std`
- C++ is a **statically** typed language. Static typing helps us to prevent errors before our code runs.
- Overloading

### Stream

1. stream: an abstraction for input/output. Streams convert between data and the **string representation** of data.

2. `std::cout` has a type `std::ostream`. Only use `<<` to send data, by converting any type into string and sends to the stream.

   `cout` is a global constant object

3. `std::ofstream`---`<<`- send to **file stream**

   - initialize: `std::ofstream out("out.txt",std::ofstream::out)`

4. `std::cin` has type `std::istream`and use `>>` operator. convert a string from stream to data

   - each `>>` only reads until the next whitespace
   - Everything after the first whitespace gets saved and used the next time `std::cin`--The place is called **buffer**

5. To read a whole line, use

   ```cpp
   std::getline(istream& stream, string& line);
   ```

6. `std::ifstream`
7. Stringsreams
   - `istringstream` `ostringstream`
   - `ostringsream oss("Ito En Green Tea")` The position is starts at begin.
   - use`stringstream::ate`![image-20211222234751024](https://gitee.com/dongramesez/typora-img/raw/master/img/202112222347161.png)

8. `std::getline(istream& stream, string& line)`

### Initialization and Reference

1. `std::pair`is a template.

   ```c++
   std::pair<int, string> = numsuffix = {1, "st"};
   return make_pair(1,"st");
   ```

2. `auto` does not mean that the variable doesn’t have a type.  It means that the type is deduced by the compiler. 

   Don’t overuse `auto`... but use it reduce long type names

3. Initialization: How we provide initial values to variables.

   Uniform initialization: curly bracket initialization. Available for all types, immediate initialization on declaration! 

4. Reference: An alias for a named variable.

   ```cpp
   void changeX(int& x){  x  = 0;  }
   void keepX(int x){x = 0;}
   int a = 100;int b = 100;
   changeX(a); //x becomes a reference to x
   keepX(b);   //x becomes a copy of x
   cout << a << endl;//0 
   cout << b << endl; //100
   
   ```

   - The classic reference-copy bug:

     ```cpp
     void shift(vector<std::pair<int, int>>& nums) {
     for (auto [num1, num2]: nums) {
     num1++;
     num2++;
     }
     }// This is updating that same copy!
     //This creates a copy of the course
     
     ```

     To fix the bug, we need to use &

5. I-values vs. r-values
   - `int x = 3` x is l-values
   - l-values has names and are **not temporary**
   - 3 is a r-value which has no name and are temporary
6. `const` indicates a variable can’t be modified

### Containers

1.  What’s in the STL?

   Containers, Iterators, Functions and Algorithms

3. How is a deque actually implemented?![](https://gitee.com/dongramesez/typora-img/raw/master/img/202112231628538.png)

4. Summary of Sequence Containers

   `std::vector`: use for almost everything 
   `std::deque`: use if you are frequently inserting/removing at front 
   `std::list`: use very rarely, and only if you need to split/join multiple lists

5. Container Adaptors : `std:stack` `std:queue` `std::priority_queue`
   - `std::queue ` `std::stack` act as a wrapper to the underlying container - only a specific set of functions is provided.
6. **Associative** Containers: Data is accessed using the key instead of indexes.

Includes: 

```cpp
	std::map<T1,T2>
	std::set<T>
    std::unordered_map<T1,T2>
    std::unordered_set<T>
```

- By default, the type or key’s type must have a comparison operator (<) defined. `map or set`

- Map[word] (automatically create an entry and default initialize it )vs. Map.**get(word)** (throw an error)
